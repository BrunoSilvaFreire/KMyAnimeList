#KMyAnimeList
This is a WIP Kotlin wrapper for the [MyAnimeList API](https://myanimelist.net/modules.php?go=api).

For those who are not aware of what Kotlin is, it is a language that compiles to JVM bytecode, so yes, you can use 
this in your Java project because it is 100% interoperable with Java.

More documentation to come soon.
